This is BarBuddy! An inventory management WebApp made for local bars to manage their inventory. I made this project with my grandmother's bar in mind. 
She manages the finances there, and everything is done on paper or google docs. The bar infrastructure of the bar is also dated as they have no computers. 
I figured a webapp would be most accessible as the bartenders could access the site from their phones and my grandma and the owner could access the inventory from home.
This is my first ever project created using Django and I learned a lot along the way. 

Admin/superuser: Access admin website controls with "local host"/admin. Here you can add products and orders as well as manage user access. 
                  When ligged into the website this user also has access to dashboard graphs and order/product summaries

Staff user: Has access to the staff version of the website where they can request orders of out of stock items during shift.
